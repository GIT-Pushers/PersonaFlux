interface CharacterRequest {
  character_name: string;      // Required: Character's name
  traits: string[];           // Required: Array of personality traits
  age?: number;              // Optional: Character age

  -d '{
    "character_name": "Aria Shadowmere",
    "traits": ["mysterious", "intelligent", "brave"],
    "age": 28,
    "gender": "female",
    "language": "English"
  }'
```

  ending_scenes: string[];    // Array of 3 possible endings
}
```

##### Example Response
```json
{
  "backstory": "Aria Shadowmere grew up in the twilight realm between worlds, where reality bends and shadows dance with their own will. As a child, she discovered she could communicate with the spirits that lingered in the boundary spaces, learning ancient secrets that most mortals were never meant to know.\n\nDriven by an insatiable curiosity and a deep sense of justice, Aria dedicated her life to protecting the balance between the living and the dead. Her intelligence allows her to unravel complex supernatural mysteries, while her bravery drives her to face dangers that would terrify even seasoned warriors.",
  "story_context": "The realm of Umbraleth exists in perpetual dusk, where gothic spires pierce the eternal purple sky and ancient magic flows through crystalline ley lines. Political tensions run high as the Shadow Court and the Twilight Council vie for control over the mystical barriers that keep darker entities at bay.\n\nRecently, several barriers have begun to weaken, allowing malevolent spirits to seep through into the mortal realm. The city's inhabitants grow increasingly fearful as unexplained phenomena plague their daily lives, and both factions blame each other for the deteriorating magical defenses.",
  "starting_propt": "You find Aria standing before a flickering barrier of purple light, her silver eyes reflecting an otherworldly knowledge as she turns to you with urgent purpose.",
  "start_options": [
    "\"What's happening to the barrier? Can I help you investigate?\"",
    "\"You look troubled. Is there something I can do to ease your burden?\"",
    "\"I don't trust magic or those who wield it. Convince me you're not the threat here.\""
  ],
  "ending_scenes": [
    "Together, you successfully restore the barriers and Aria is recognized as a guardian of both realms, finding peace in her dual nature.",
    "Aria sacrifices her connection to the spirit world to permanently seal the barriers, becoming fully mortal but saving countless lives.",
    "The barriers are stabilized, but Aria vanishes into the shadow realm, leaving behind only cryptic warnings about future threats."
  ]
}
```
